0x19. Postmortem task on an API Timeout Due to Missing Index in Calorie & Nutrient Tracker

# Issue Summary
Duration: February 28, 2025, 10:30 AM â€“ 11:00 AM (WAT)

## Impact: 
Around 30% of users experienced slow load times when fetching food data. API response times exceeded 10 seconds, leading to delays in retrieving calorie and nutrient information.

## Root Cause: 
A missing database index caused a query fetching food items to perform a full table scan, significantly increasing response times.

## Timeline

- 10:30 AM (WAT): Monitoring alert triggered due to high API response times.

- 10:35 AM: Frontend engineer reported slow API responses in the UI.

- 10:40 AM: Backend team checked logs and identified a slow SQL query.

- 10:45 AM: Investigation revealed the lack of an index on the food_name column.

- 10:50 AM: Index added to food_name, improving query performance.

- 11:00 AM: API response times returned to normal, issue resolved.

# Root Cause and Resolution

## Root Cause:
A key database query was performing a full table scan due to a missing index on the food_name column in the PostgreSQL database. This caused increased query execution times under moderate load.

## Resolution:

- An index was created on food_name, allowing faster lookups.

- Queries were optimized to take advantage of indexed searches.

- Database performance monitoring was updated to detect slow queries earlier.

- Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:

- Ensure proper indexing on frequently queried columns.

- Enhance database monitoring for slow queries.

- Automate query performance checks.

## Task List:



## Example Fix - SQL Script
To prevent similar issues in the future, the following SQL command was executed to add the missing index:

CREATE INDEX idx_food_name ON food_items(food_name);

## Query Debugging Flow
To ensure faster debugging in the future, we propose the following step-by-step approach:

[Query Performance Alert] --> [Check Slow Queries Log] --> [Identify Missing Index] --> [Create Index] --> [Verify Performance Improvement]

By implementing these measures, we aim to improve database efficiency and prevent similar slowdowns in the future.
